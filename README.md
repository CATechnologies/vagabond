# Vagabond

Vagabond is currently a work-in-progress. Features may be missing or subject to change.

## What it is

Vagabond — until the 0.1.0 release — is a playground for a few different approaches for integration testing of infrastructure. We're still determining how best to handle a lot of things with the goal of making  Vagabond very modular so we can re-use parts of it for other, similar projects (think Vagabond but on EC2 / Rackspace).

## What it isn't

Stable (yet).

Finished (yet).

## That Said...

We'd love some of your help or input!

## Developing

1. Install VirtualBox.

2. Install Bundler.

3. Run `bundle install`

4. Run `rake vagabond:spec`
